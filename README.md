Cuda Lab CSS535

Lab File setup:

Clone project into folder

IDE Setup:

Visual studio 2022 

Open new cuda project (in a seperate folder)

Solution -> add external file (add all files from the cloned folder)

This will keep all the source files in the cloned folder because we all have differnt development environments so you will have a seperate environmet of your choosing.

After changed made to files save and push from the cloned folder.


Please add to this for those using nvcc or other IDE so we are keeping this updated
