I've managed to create profile documents that contain all the configurations for parts 1 and 3. 

Just change the kernel in the results dropdown list to swap configurations. The summary page lists which configs are which, but I did them in the experiment order. 

Part 1 is missing some configs that we discarded for parts 2 and 3. 

Still working on fixing part 2 so we can do the same for timing and memory usage data.
